# spinachent_jakub
Matlab scripts using Spinach spin dynamics library to simulate the entanglement +tomography pulse sequences

Spinach can be downloaded from https://spindynamics.org/group/?page_id=12

The files in this directory need to be added to Matlab path alongside Spinach, with priority over Spinach 

The only file run directly is ent_all_clean.m
